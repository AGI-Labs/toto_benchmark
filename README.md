# TOTO_starter
## Instructions
- Update the agent file: `agents/CollaboratorAgent.py`. This acts as a wrapper around your model to interface with the robot stack. Please refer to `agents/Agent.py` for more information
- Update the agent config file `outputs/collaborator_agent/hydra.yaml` for initializing your agent
- Once the above is done, run `python test_stub_env.py -f outputs/collaborator_agent/` for a simple simulated test on the robot. If everything works as expected, we are ready to have the agent to be evaluated on the real robot!
